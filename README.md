Simple page for academic websites on Hexo, crafted from Jekyll/academicpages.

## Introduction
This is a light & simple & responsive theme for academic websites on Hexo, crafted from [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) on Jekyll. Thanks a lot.

The theme adopts only `post` and `page` in Hexo to show your informations. For an academic page, it's important to be simple and obvious.

Example page: [phosphorw.github.io](https://phosphorw.github.io/)

```

## Create your academic page

Only `post` and `page` are supported in this theme.

Only post with `academia: true` front_matter will be shown on home (index) page. You can write your informations in either one post or some posts with this method. The front_matter doesn't works in `page`. The `pages` are standalone with its markdown content.


## Theme Configurtion
All of below options can be config in theme folder `_config.yml`

- Top Menu: in-page anchor, new page links or any links you like
- Side Bar: Support avatar, social links, extra social links (optional), CV_download_link
- Box-shadow mode (optional)

All icons in page is supported with [font-awesome-5](https://fontawesome.com/) (~~font-awesome-4~~)

> fontawesome-4 is not used since v1.2.1. If you want to update manually, first change CDN stylesheet to fa5. Then change your previous icon class `fa` to `fas` or `fas`.

If you need rss feed, use hexo plugin: [hexo-generator-feed](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed)
