Simple page for academic websites on Hexo, crafted from Jekyll/academicpages.

## Introduction
This is a light & simple & responsive theme for academic websites on Hexo, crafted from [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) on Jekyll. Thanks a lot.

The theme adopts only `post` and `page` in Hexo to show your information. For an academic page, it's important to be simple and clear.

Example page: [phosphorw.github.io](https://phosphorw.github.io/)

## Installation

```

Some required renderers:
```
npm install hexo-renderer-pug hexo-renderer-stylus --save
```

Set theme in hexo work folder's `_config.yml`
```
theme: Academia
```

## Create your academic page

Only `post` and `page` are supported in this theme.

```
or
```
hexo n page "any title"
```

**Important:** </br>
Add `academia: true` in front_matter filed in `post .md`.

Only post with `academia: true` front_matter will be shown on home (index) page. You can write your information in either one post or some posts with this method. The front_matter doesn't work in `page`. The `pages` are standalone with its markdown content.


## Theme Configuration
All the following options can be config in the theme folder `_config.yml`

- Top Menu: in-page anchor, new page links or any links you like
- Side Bar: Support avatar, social links, extra social links (optional), CV_download_link
- Box-shadow mode (optional)

All icons in the page is supported with [font-awesome-5](https://fontawesome.com/) (~~font-awesome-4~~)

> fontawesome-4 is deprecated since v1.2.1. If you want to update manually, firstly change CDN stylesheet to fa5. Then change your previous icon class `fa` to `fas` or `fas`.

If you need rss feed, use hexo plugin: [hexo-generator-feed](https://github.com/hexojs/hexo-generator-feed)
